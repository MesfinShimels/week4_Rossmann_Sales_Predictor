Rossmann Sales Predictor
Overview
The Rossmann Sales Predictor is a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at forecasting sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals stores up to six weeks in advance. This project equips the finance team with data-driven insights into customer purchasing behavior and helps improve sales planning. Predictions are derived from various factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.
Business Need
Currently, store managers rely on intuition and experience to predict sales. This project introduces a data-driven machine learning solution to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of sales forecasting. It enables better planning for promotions, inventory, staffing, and resource allocation.
Key Features
Accurate Sales Forecasting: Uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict sales with high accuracy.
Data-Driven Insights: Incorporates factors like holidays, promotions, and competition into the forecasting model.
Reproducible Pipelines: Builds robust pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
Exploratory Analysis: Analyzes sales trends, customer behavior, and external factors.
Requirements
Software
Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook or an IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

How to Use
1. Set Up Environment
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Activate the virtual environment located in the myenv directory.
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess data using scripts in the scripts/ folder.
Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Open EDA.ipynb in the notebook/ folder to explore customer purchasing behavior.
Logs for the EDA process are saved in eda.log.
4. Model Building
Use Prediction.ipynb to build, tune, and serialize machine learning models.
Serialized models are saved in the models/ folder.
5. Deep Learning
Implement the LSTM model for time series prediction in a dedicated script or notebook.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Steps:
1.Descriptive Statistics 
oAnalyze summary statistics for all columns.
2.Data Visualization 
oVisualize trends in sales, customer behavior, and the impact of external factors such as holidays and promotions.
3.Feature Engineering 
oExtract features from datetime data, create lag variables, and incorporate external data such as holidays.
4.Logging 
oCapture preprocessing and EDA steps in eda.log for reproducibility.
Logs and Findings
Logs
eda.log: Contains step-by-step documentation of the data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering steps performed during EDA.
Findings
Exploratory Findings: 
oStrong seasonal trends observed in sales data.
oPromotions significantly impact customer behavior and sales.
oHoliday effects vary based on the type and timing of holidays.
Predictive Findings: 
oImportant features include store type, competition distance, promotions, and holiday indicators.
oLinear regression and tree-based models yield promising results during initial evaluation.
Data
Source
Rossmann Store Sales | Kaggle
Fields
Store: Unique identifier for stores.
Sales: Store sales for a given day.
Customers: Number of customers for a given day.
Open: Whether the store was open or closed.
Promo: Whether the store was running a promotion.
StateHoliday: Indicates a state holiday.
Next Steps
1.Advanced Modeling 
oExperiment with ensemble models like XGBoost and CatBoost.
oEvaluate hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Bayesian Optimization.
2.Time Series Analysis 
oImplement and test advanced time series models like SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.
